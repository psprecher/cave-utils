Cave mapping utilities

This contains miscellanous utilities I find helpful for quickly and easily generating maps in [Therion](https://therion.speleo.sk/) based on sketches in [TopoDroid](https://sites.google.com/site/speleoapps/home/topodroid).

## Setup

1. Install TopoDroid and Therion per their instructions. Make sure to use the apk version of TopoDroid (TopoDroid-X) rather than the google play version.
2. Add the data files in `topodroid/` to topo droid, `data/com.TopoDroid.TDX/files/...`

## Mapping Workflow

TBD
